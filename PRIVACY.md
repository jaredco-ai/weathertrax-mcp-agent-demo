WeatherTrax MCP Server — Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025‑08‑12

What we collect
	•	Request metadata: IP address, timestamp, HTTP method/path, response status, latency (ms).
	•	Operational logs: Aggregated usage counts, error codes, uptime/health metrics.

What we do not collect
	•	No persistent storage of tool inputs (e.g., location strings) or outputs beyond transient logs needed for reliability and abuse prevention.
	•	No cookies, trackers, or ad technology.

Retention
	•	Raw request logs: ≤ 14 days (default).
	•	Aggregated metrics: up to 90 days.
	•	You can request earlier deletion of log entries by referencing timestamp and IP (subject to feasibility).

Purpose
	•	Ensure reliability, debug errors, detect abuse (rate limiting), and improve performance.

Sharing
	•	No selling or sharing of logs with third parties. Hosting provider (e.g., Railway) processes data as our infrastructure vendor.

Security
	•	TLS enforced end‑to‑end. Principle of least privilege for access to logs and deployments.

Your choices
	•	If your compliance needs require it, you may run a self‑hosted copy and disable logging (see TELEMETRY=off).
